Welcome to my web portfolio! Here you will find a showcase of my latest web development projects, highlighting my skills, and demonstrating my passion for coding engaging user interactions.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- AOS Library
- SweetAlert Library

## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Reponsiveness
- Form submission
- Moving components and animations

## Process

This was my first Web Development Project. I decided to hard code everything so I can learn how to manually do certain interactions. I had lots of fun learning the structure and how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all played together.

I also had to utilize a lot of open resources but that also lead me to finding the AOS and SweetAlert Libraries. I believe adding those two libraries helped improve the design of my website.

After completing the bones and styling of the project, I also had to do a lot of trial and error when making my website fully responsive. Overall, I had such a fun time learning the basics of Web Development.

## Learnings

- Structures of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Learned how to utilize outside libraries
- How to design responsive webpages
- Flex design
- Improved on my JavaScript
- Learned website design composition

## Improvements

- Cleaner code - Simplify CSS code
- Include some API, possibly the Spotify or Google API on the About Section
- More information on the Project cards
- Better footer responsiveness
